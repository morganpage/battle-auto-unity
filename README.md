> Exactly what I was looking for. Hooks, canvas, and roguelikes. Lots of good design patterns as well, at least so far. I will be going through this course but trying to implement the features using typescript. Please continue with another intermediate course. Thanks much.

> Very cool what you can do in under 3.5hrs! Morgan breaks down core concepts and gives you an overview of all the tooling needed to be successful with your game idea. Nice pacing and fairly comprehensive! Would love to see a more in dept discussion about grouping and managing assets and resources in both Tiled and Phaser. Great Tutorial!
